# pr-practices-ts
This is a basic TypeScript project that simulates a minimal Formula 1 management system. It allows you to register drivers and teams, simulate races, and track driver standings.  The goal is to get familiar with Git collaboration through branches, pull requests, and code reviews, while also practicing clean and modular coding in TypeScript.
